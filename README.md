# Project-1
Python Hangman Game

- A text file contains lower case words to guess for gameplay.
- User gets 6 wrong guesses before the stick man hangs (you loose).
- Catches if you're guessing a letter already guessed
- Multiple plays
- Shows progress on the word/if and where your letter fits 

Line #94 Prints the chosen word for presentation purposes.
Line #52 Prints # of words loaded for testing purposes.

Note: Got rid of an unnecessary import and got rid of some redundant code/fixed buffer error (flush = true)
